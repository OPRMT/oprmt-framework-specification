## 2. Framework Definition

### 2.1 Overview

OPRMT™ is a five-component structured framework for constructing AI prompts that produce consistent, predictable, and professional-grade outputs.

### 2.2 Acronym Expansion

| Component | Full Term   | Function |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| O         | Objective   | Defines the desired outcome |
| P         | Parameters  | Specifies constraints and inputs |
| R         | Results     | Establishes success criteria |
| M         | Method      | Describes the execution approach |
| T         | Tools       | Identifies required resources |

## 3. Component Specification

### 3.1 Objective (O)

**Definition:** A clear, unambiguous statement of the intended outcome.  
**Requirements:**
- Must be specific and measurable
- Must articulate a single primary goal
- Must be achievable within stated parameters

---

### 3.2 Parameters (P)

**Definition:** Explicit constraints, variables, and boundary conditions governing execution.  
**Requirements:**
- Must define all relevant limitations
- Must specify input data sources
- Must establish quality standards

---

### 3.3 Results (R)

**Definition:** Concrete deliverables and success criteria that determine task completion.  
**Requirements:**
- Must specify output format
- Must define completion criteria
- Must establish quality benchmarks

---

### 3.4 Method (M)

**Definition:** The procedural approach, reasoning strategy, or workflow to be employed.  
**Requirements:**
- Must outline logical sequence of steps
- Must identify decision-making approaches

---

### 3.5 Tools (T)

**Definition:** Resources, platforms, capabilities, or integrations required or permitted for execution.  
**Requirements:**
- Must list all necessary tools

---

## 4. Implementation Standards

### 4.1 Component Ordering

Components must be presented in the following sequence:
1. Objective
2. Parameters
3. Results
4. Method
5. Tools

**Rationale:** This order follows natural problem-solving logic from goal definition through resource allocation.

---

### 4.2 Component Completeness

All five components **must be present** for valid OPRMT™ implementation.  
Components **may not be renamed or reordered**.  
Partial implementations do **not** constitute OPRMT™ framework usage.
