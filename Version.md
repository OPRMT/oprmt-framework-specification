Usage rules and implementation standards
Governance and version control procedures
Canonical Reference
The authoritative specification for Version 1.0 is permanently archived and accessible at:
https://oprmt.solutions/OPRMT%E2%84%A2%20Framework%20%E2%80%94%20Official%20Canonical%20Specification
All implementations, distributions, mirrors, and derivative references must cite this URL as the definitive source for framework specifications.
Distribution Requirements
Secondary distributions of this specification must:
Reference the canonical source URL in all documentation
Maintain version number accuracy and consistency
Include complete attribution to the framework creator
Clearly identify themselves as mirrors or derivative references
Synchronize with the canonical source for updates
Version Control Policy
Semantic Versioning Structure
The OPRMT™ framework employs semantic versioning using the format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH:
Major Versions (X.0.0)
Major version increments indicate:
Fundamental structural modifications to the framework
Changes to core component definitions or scope
Alterations to component ordering or requirements
Modifications affecting backward compatibility
Significant governance or usage policy changes
Examples: v1.0.0 → v2.0.0
Impact Assessment: May require implementation updates and review
Minor Versions (1.X.0)
Minor version increments indicate:
Component clarifications without structural changes
Expanded usage guidelines or best practices
Additional examples or implementation guidance
Documentation enhancements and elaborations
Non-breaking governance clarifications
Examples: v1.0.0 → v1.1.0
Impact Assessment: Typically backward compatible; review recommended
Patch Versions (1.0.X)
Patch version increments indicate:
Typographical error corrections
Formatting improvements
Documentation link updates
Non-substantive clarifications
Administrative metadata updates
Examples: v1.0.0 → v1.0.1
Impact Assessment: Minimal; no implementation changes required
Version Increment Criteria

Publication Protocol
Primary Publication
All official version releases must be published first to the canonical source:
https://oprmt.solutions/oprmt-framework-official-canonical-specification
This canonical source serves as:
The authoritative reference for the current version
The official archive for all historical versions
The primary distribution point for specifications
The definitive source for version verification
Publication Sequence
Official version releases follow this mandatory sequence:
Internal Review: Creator validation of all changes
Version Assignment: Determination of appropriate version number
Canonical Publication: Update to the official specification URL https://oprmt.solutions/oprmt-framework-official-canonical-specification
Version Documentation: Update to this version history document
Public Notification: Announcement through official channels
Mirror Synchronization: Authorization for secondary distributions to update
Mirror Update Policy
Authorized mirror repositories and secondary distributions:
Must not publish version updates before the canonical source
Must verify version accuracy against the canonical source
Should implement automated synchronization where feasible
Must include version number and canonical source reference
Should notify the creator of synchronization completion
Version Authority and Governance
Sole Authority
Version control authority resides exclusively with the framework creator:
Michael Willis Fleming
This authority encompasses:
Determination of version increment magnitude
Approval of all specification changes
Publication timing and sequencing
Version deprecation or retirement decisions
Historical version archival and maintenance
Version Review Process
The creator employs the following review process for version changes:
Change Proposal: Documentation of proposed modifications
Impact Analysis: Assessment of change magnitude and compatibility
Version Classification: Determination of Major/Minor/Patch designation
Specification Update: Revision of official documentation
Quality Assurance: Verification of accuracy and completeness
Publication Authorization: Approval for canonical source update
Community Input
While version control authority remains exclusively with the creator:
Community feedback is valued and considered
Error reports are reviewed and addressed
Improvement suggestions may inform minor/patch updates
Clarification requests may trigger documentation enhancements
All community input is subject to creator review and approval before incorporation.
Backward Compatibility
Compatibility Commitment
The OPRMT™ framework maintains the following compatibility commitment:
Minor and Patch Versions: Guaranteed backward compatibility
Existing implementations remain valid
No breaking changes to component structure
Additive clarifications only
Major Versions: Potential breaking changes
Advance notice provided when feasible
Migration guidance published
Compatibility notes documented
Transition period considerations
Deprecation Policy
Should any framework elements require deprecation:
Announcement: Minimum 90-day advance notice
Documentation: Clear migration pathways provided
Support Period: Continued documentation of deprecated elements
Archival: Permanent accessibility of historical specifications
